    Safely removes the Mod Name Folder

    This is very critical! In order to use symlinks on Windows without requiring admin privs we have to use
    "Directory Junctions", it's a special type of symlink intended for different purposes but works for our case.
    However Python doesn't support Directory Junctions, in fact it can't tell the difference between a directory
    junction and a real folder, it thinks they're the same.

    This means if you don't safely remove the Scripts directory junction, the original source code files the dev is
    working on will be wiped out irrecoverably when doing a re-compile or a re-devmode-setup. In other words, the dev
    will forever lose all the files they were working on as part of their project unless they had a backup elsewhere.
    Their hard work vanishes before their eyes just like that.

    This is unnacceptable, to have a safety process in check, this function removes the mod folder, safely removing
    the scripts folder beforehand. If it's unable to it creates a crash so as to not proceed.

    Always use this function to remove the Mod Name Folder
