# Thank you to Sigma1202 from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBnS8m0174U
# for coming up with this process

# This follows Sigma1202 process
#
# PyCharm Professional provides an ability to insert debug capability into an external system and then tap into that
# ability.
#
# This is a 2 part process:
# Part 1) Install the debugging capability, this is located in an egg file, we must modify the egg and then properly
# install it as a mod so the game will load it and gain the ability to debug with PyCharm Pro
# Part 2) We must get the game to reach out to our editor, to do this Sigma1202 has come up with the idea of a cheat
# command. This command makes theg ame reach out to PyCharm Pro, initiate the debugging connection, and then you're
# ready to start debugging.
#
# The command I developed is 'pycharm.debug' and I've hopefully made all of this very easy for the end user.
